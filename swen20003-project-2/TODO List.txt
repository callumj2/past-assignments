- Abstract out logic from 'Level' into ShadowDefend so that only instances
 of the game are passed between classes
- Rejig Slicer spawning to list format with dynamic add/remove DONE :)
- Fix up Timekeeper class to not include 'enemy' terminology
-Remove or refactor subfolders in src directory
-Look into fixing 0 vs 1 offset issues in waveset and wave
- Move slicers into level class
- fix up vector vs point discrepancies
- Add in exclusive targeting
Idea for level class: ideally would have one broad arraylist of gameobjects, 
containing slicers, towers, projectiles, everything so that the update call is just a single for loop, but also have getter functions to be 
able to pull out those same game objects but grouped into their respective classes
